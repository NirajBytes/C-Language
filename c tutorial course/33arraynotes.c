/* WHAT IS AN ARRAY?

An array is a collection of data items of the same type

■Items are stored at contiguous memory locations.

It can also store the collection of derived data types, such as pointers, structures, etc.

■ A one-dimensional array is like a list.

A two-dimensional array is like a table.

The C language places no limits on the number of dimensions in an array.

■ Some texts refer to one-dimensional arrays as vectors, two-dimensional arrays as matrices,

and use the general term arrays when the number of dimensions is unspecified or unimportant.


WHY DO WE NEED ARRAYS?

■ Code that use arrays is sometimes more organized and readable.

■If you were to store the marks in a test of 56 students, creating 56 variables will make program look cluttered and messy.

Solution to this is arrays!

We can create arrays of integers and store the consecutive marks corresponding to the roll number in the array

ADVANTAGE OF ARRAYS

It is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name

■ Accessing an item in a given array is very fast!

☐ 2 Dimensional arrays makes it easy in mathematical applications as it is used to represent a matrix.

PROPERTIES OF ARRAY

Data in an array is stored in contiguous memory locations

Each element of an array is of same size

Any element of the array with given index can be accessed very quickly by using its address which can be calculated using the base address and the index.
